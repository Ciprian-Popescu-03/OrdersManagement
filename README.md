# Orders Management App üì¶

Welcome to the **Orders Management App**, a desktop application developed with **Java Swing**.
Its purpose is to manage client orders for a warehouse, including product, client, and order management, with all data stored in a **PostgreSQL database**.

---

# Description üìñ

The application is designed using a **layered architecture** and provides a **main GUI window** where users can:

* **Manage Products**: Open the product management window to add, edit, delete, and view products.
* **Manage Clients**: Open the client management window to add, edit, delete, and view clients.
* **Manage Orders**: Open the order management window to create orders, select products and clients, specify quantities, and automatically update stock. Under-stock messages are displayed when quantities are insufficient.
* **Generate Bills**: Automatically generate an immutable **Bill** for each order and store it in the Log table.
* **Reflection-Based Table Handling**: Dynamically generate table headers and populate table data using reflection.

All application logic is separated into **model, business, data access, and presentation layers** for clean code and maintainability. Data is persisted in a **PostgreSQL database**, and generic CRUD operations use reflection for dynamic SQL generation.
